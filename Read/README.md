  NoSql challenge 
  
  


## Description
For this challenge i had to create a social media app that allows you to create a user make thoughts, add friends, and react to others thoughts. The thoughts and the users routes also allows you to remove friends, thoughts, and reactions. I complete this challenge using mongo db. Ive learned a new way to track and make a schema and easier ways to track edit and create information in compass.
